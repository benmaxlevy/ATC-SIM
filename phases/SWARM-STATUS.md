# Swarm status

## Run started

Orchestrator started **2026-08-20**. Resume from the first phase that is not green. Do not redo merged tickets.

## Config (frozen for this run)

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Implement **phase 0 → 1 → 2** until each README **Phase exit** is green |
| Stop | **Do not start phase 3, 4, or 5.** No `speech-api`, no PTT, no T03-* |
| Max ticket workers in flight | **3** |
| Phase 2 ∥ phase 3 | **No** — serial. Voice is a later swarm |
| Merge lock | **Only the phase captain** merges to `master` (`--no-ff`) |
| Paid STT/TTS | Forbidden (irrelevant this run; still do not add vendor SDKs) |
| Model | **cursor grok 4.6 high only.** No fast. Captains and ticket workers must set Task `model: cursor-grok-4.6-high`. |

## Progress

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 Slice | **GREEN** | Waves A–F merged T00-01 … T00-10. `npm test` / `npm run ci` exit 0. |
| 1 Closed loop | **in progress** | Captain spawning (cursor grok 4.6 high). Waves A–I per `SWARM.md`. |
| 2 Scope | not started | |
| 3 Voice | **out of scope this run** | |
| 4 Procedures | **out of scope this run** | |
| 5 Training | **out of scope this run** | |

## Log

- 2026-08-20: Orchestrator started. Repo was unborn `master` (planning files untracked). Seeded `master` with `phases/`, `README.md`, `.cursor/rules/` so ticket branches can fork. Spawned phase 0 captain (`phases/00-slice/`).
- 2026-08-20: Human: **cursor grok 4.6 high only — no fast.** Interrupted phase 0 captain mid Wave D. Further Task spawns used `model: cursor-grok-4.6-high`.
- 2026-08-20: Phase 0 captain: all T00-01 … T00-10 merged `--no-ff` on `master`. Exit checks green. Did not start phase 1.
- 2026-08-20: Orchestrator `npm test` on `master`: 41/41 passed.
- 2026-08-20: Human: commit the uncommitted planning edits on `master`, then spawn phase 1. Orchestrator committing parse-pipeline / `Command.parseStage` / T01+T03+T05 ticket wording (not application code), then spawning phase 1 captain on **cursor grok 4.6 high**.

## Phase 0 captain notes

- **Merged:** T00-01, T00-02, T00-03, T00-04, T00-06, T00-07, T00-05, T00-08, T00-09, T00-10 (wave order A–F).
- **Tests:** `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run ci` all exit 0 (41 Vitest tests).
- **Wave D interrupt:** working tree had mixed T00-04/T00-06 files. Captain reset the mix, merged already-committed T00-04 and T00-07, discarded the stale T00-06 worktree, and re-spawned T00-06 from updated `master` on grok 4.6 high. Later waves used isolated worktrees.
- **Manual leftover:** human eyeball of `npm run dev` — dark full-viewport Scope, frozen disclaimer visible, empty PPI placeholder, command line echoes submitted text, no browser console errors, no mic/audio prompt on boot. Vite served `index.html` locally; React chrome was not pixel-checked in a browser by the captain.
